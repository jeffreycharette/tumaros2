      <p class="style2">Dear Capital Campaign Cabinet,</p>
      <p class="style2">Three months have passed since the ICA&rsquo;s Campaign Cabinet last met. This is our first quarterly Cabinet eBriefing, fulfilling our commitment to provide regular updates on the progress of the campaign and the new facility.</p>
      <p class="style2"><strong> Campaign News </strong></p>
      <p class="style2"> Successes to-date include: </p>
      <p class="style2">The <em>Major Gifts Committee</em>, led by Chair Wanda Kownacki, kicked off in September and is charged with securing 20&plusmn; gifts of $50,000 and above toward a committee goal of $3.1 million. Against this goal, $1,554,000 has already been raised to-date. Currently, the committee has five pending decisions and is preparing for the solicitations of 17 individual priority prospects. </p>
      <p class="style2">The <em>Special Gifts Committee</em>, led by Julie Nelson-Gal, and Vice Chairs Leslie Barton, Shannon Eagle and Rick Holden, is 100% recruited! The committee is set to kick off on October 10th and has a goal to secure 75&plusmn; gifts of $5,000 and above toward a goal of $925,000. Nearly 32% of this goal has been raised to-date through earlier gifts made to the campaign.</p>
      <ul class="style2">
        <li>A big thanks to Chair, Rick Holden as the Campaign <em>Communications Committee</em> prepares to wind down its work. The committee worked hard to develop a campaign theme, key messages and collateral materials that will continue to energize the community and inspire generous giving among donors. I am sending a copy of the campaign brochure to all of you via snail mail.</li>
        </ul>
      <p class="style2"><strong> Facility Update </strong></p>
      <p class="style2">Since purchasing the building this spring, we have been working with architect Bill Gould and a team of expert advisors to develop a dynamic, flexible, and exciting design for the space. Highlights include:</p>
      <ul class="style2">
        <li>Doubling our gallery space to increase the number of exhibitions we present</li>
        <li>Adding a Printmaking Center that will host group and individual workshops as well as artist residencies</li>
        <li>Providing a resource library for artists, collectors, and art lovers</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="style2">We have just hired Novo Construction as the General Contractor for the buildout and will begin working with them next week.</p>
      <p class="style2"><strong> Ongoing Exhibitions </strong></p>
      <p class="style2">We hope you&rsquo;ll have a chance to come in before the end of January so that you can see the new space before we completely transform it. In addition to seeing the building, there are lots of other reasons to come in. Our Annual <em>Fall Art Auction</em> will be held on Saturday, October 28th. Exceptional pieces from the region's most established artists and hottest emerging artists have been donated for the event. We&rsquo;d like to extend an invitation to be our guest at a <strong>Private Reception and Preview</strong> of the auction, on Friday, October 20 th from 6-8 p.m. This will be a unique opportunity to meet contributing artists and preview pieces reflecting the most current and up-and-coming trends of art-making. If you are unable to attend the preview reception, the exhibition is on view from October 6 &ndash; 28. This year's event provides the perfect opportunity for patrons to expand their collections as we expand our facility.</p>
      <p class="style2"> From November 6 &ndash; 17, internationally recognized Bay Area painter Darren Waterston will be in residence working on a site-specific mural installation that will completely cover the gallery walls and transform the interior of the ICA. The gallery will be open while Waterston and a team of assistants work to complete the project. This will be a unique opportunity to see an artist at work and to watch the mural progress to completion. Entitled <em>Was and Is Not and Is to Come, </em>the completed mural will open on Friday, November 17th and continue through mid-January when we close for renovations. In conjunction with the installation, we will be publishing a brochure documenting the process and the finished piece. </p>
      <P class=MsoNormal style2><span class="style2">Thank you again for your ongoing support. Continue to look for quarterly updates regarding the building and capital campaign progress. And, once again, please be sure to get in and see the space before we begin the renovations. I am certain that the &ldquo;before and after&rdquo; will be quite dramatic!<o:p></o:p><o:p></o:p></span><span class="style4"><o:p></o:p></span><o:p></o:p></P>
