      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On the heels of its recent show, <em><a href="http://sjica.org/exhibitions/NextNew_Green/Green.html">NextNew:Green</a> </em>that featured the works of emerging Bay Area artists exploring issues related to conservation, the environment and global warming, the San Jose Institute of Contemporary Art (ICA) presents <em>Afterlife, </em>a group exhibition of works created to breathe new life into re-purposed materials and objects.&nbsp; Guest curated by Kathryn Funk, <em>Afterlife</em> will be exhibited in the ICA's Main Gallery and Cardinale Project Room from November 7, 2009 through January 23, 2010.&nbsp; The show includes sculpture, video, and multi-media work from artist Claudia Borgna, Mark Fox-Morgan, Elisabeth Higgins O'Connor, Lisa Kokin, Charlotte Kruk, Robert Larson, Scott Oliver, Beverly Rayner, and Ann Weber.&nbsp; <br>
        <br>
        A public reception will be held at the ICA on Friday, November 6, 2009 from 6pm to 8pm. An Artist Talk moderated by Kathryn Funk will take place at the ICA on Thursday, November 12th from 7pm to 9pm. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The artists represented in <em>Afterlife</em> take advantage of cast-offs  from our contemporary lives. &nbsp;With a conscious eye to the materiality of the  chosen discards, items from the street, junkyards and second-hand stores are  transformed into fresh, inspired creations that give rise to thoughtful  consideration and interpretation. &nbsp;</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Even  before the green recycling revolution took hold, artists were reusing and  re-purposing found materials,&rdquo; says <em>Afterlif</em>e  curator Kathryn Funk. &nbsp;&ldquo;When an object  has been discharged from its original purpose it still carries some association  with its past. &nbsp;&nbsp;When that association is altered it takes on  new meaning,&rdquo; explains Funk. </font>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Exploring new meanings and new lives of  discarded and re-used materials is the central focus of the artists&rsquo; works on  view in <em>Afterlife</em>.
      </font>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">London-based artist Claudia Borgna has been collecting and using  plastic bags as an inspired muse in her art for several years, carefully  gathering and using them after each installation or performance in a different  configuration. &nbsp;&nbsp;Borgna&rsquo;s work will be on view in <em>Afterlife </em>and <em>Night Moves</em> &ndash; after dark video art programming presented in the ICA&rsquo;s front windows. </font>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Mark Fox-Morgan uses paper &ndash; a tree  by-product&mdash; cast as beams for his massive house-like structure. &nbsp;&nbsp;The  beguiling skeleton appears remarkably strong despite its extremely fragile  nature, thus calling into question the nature and exploitation of its source.&nbsp; &nbsp;Elisabeth  Higgins O&rsquo;Connor and Lisa Kokin find inspiration in materials scavenged from  flea markets and thrift stores. &nbsp;&nbsp;Higgins O&rsquo;Connor uses discarded fabrics of all  sorts and stitches together life-sized anthropomorphic stuffed animal  creatures. &nbsp;&nbsp;Kokin uses books and the book format; dissecting,  reassembling and pulping them to express new ideas and her own personal,  political and cultural views.&nbsp; &nbsp;Charlotte Kruk salvages and sews product  wrappers side by side to create new textiles in the form of wearable art.&nbsp; &nbsp;Robert  Larson gathers and dissects tossed cigarette packages and match books to make  visually stunning constructed paintings of rich color patterns, hues and  textures, with the dissected paper material. </font>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Conceptual artist Scott Oliver alters everyday objects, carefully  crafting them into a unique state that undermines their original function but  never erases the original object&rsquo;s identity.&nbsp;  &nbsp;Beverly Rayner manipulates all  kinds of discarded items and constructs new roles for them in her art as she  explores how memory distorts the truth.&nbsp; &nbsp;Ann Weber transforms cardboard boxes pulled  from dumpsters into elegant, playful biomorphic forms. </font>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Also opening on November 7th in the ICA&rsquo;s  Focus Gallery and running through February 20, 2010 is <em><a href="http://sjica.org/exhibitions/TheodoraVarnayJones/theodoravarnayjones.html">Manifold</a></em>, 
        a solo exhibition of two installations of works by San  Francisco-based postminimalist artist <br>
        Theodora Varnay Jones. &nbsp;The installations are comprised 
        of drawings, constructed works, sculptures,  and re-conceptualized ready-made pieces that represent the artist&rsquo;s exploration  and interpretation of form, space and repetition.&nbsp; A <em>Talking  Art</em> conversation with Varnay Jones will be held on Thursday, January 14th  from
        7pm to 9pm at the ICA.
