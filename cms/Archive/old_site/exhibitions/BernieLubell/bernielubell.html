      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em>Conservation of Intimacy</em> opening on July 3, is an  immersive sculptural installation presented in partnership with the O1SJ  Biennial Art and Technology Festival (September 16 &ndash; 19).</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">  In true Silicon Valley fashion, Lubell  has created his low-tech machines in his San    Francisco garage for over twenty years.&nbsp; However, instead of working with computers,  software, and electronics, the artist collaborates with pine wood and ancient  technologies&mdash;cranks, pulleys, and springs, for instance&mdash;to build the immersive  and interactive works. The deliberate handmade aesthetic, along with the  ingenuity of the complex designs, give Lubell&rsquo;s works the appearance of a  different era&mdash;a time of the master craftsmen and old technology. The creations  are in fact deeply rooted in the artist&rsquo;s research and explorations of historic  scientific instruments and obsolete machinery. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Lubell&rsquo;s <em>Conservation of Intimacy</em>&nbsp;serves as a stage where people are invited to  touch and play with the work&mdash;an unlikely, but thrilling, proposition in the  context of the &ldquo;do not touch&rdquo; policy in the gallery and museum environment. As  participants crank, rock, and create sounds with the work, they tap into what  the artist describes as the &ldquo;vast reservoir of knowledge stored in each of our  bodies,&rdquo; and become important collaborators in the realization and  understanding of this massive installation. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">With a background in engineering and psychology,  Lubell designs his interactive wood machines through experience. He begins with  a question&mdash;about intimacy, the nature of being human, the theory of  entanglement&mdash;and looks to archaic technology to manifest these complicated  concepts into a mechanical device. His trial-and-error process results in  creations that are fragile-looking yet sturdy, poetic and surreal.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Not until the works  come in contact with us, the visitors of the exhibition, do they truly come to  life.&nbsp; In Lubell&rsquo;s world of art making,  every person&rsquo;s participation is significant. The works entice the senses&mdash;they  look and feel like elaborate playground diversions and are incredibly  pleasurable to explore.&nbsp; In <em>Conservation of Intimacy,</em> two people  rock on a suspended bench while their motions are recorded as a graph by a pen  marking a roll
        of 
        paper (which is moved by the third participant pedaling on a  stationary wooden bicycle). &nbsp;With minimal instruction, visitors intuitively discover and activate the mechanics of the  multifaceted machines. &nbsp;As participants  are absorbed in the rattle and hum of the work, they delight in being alive and  engaged in the wonder of life.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Much of Lubell&rsquo;s work is inspired by the early  medical devices of French physiologist Etienne Jules Marey &nbsp;(1830&ndash;1904). &nbsp;A mechanical genius, Marey developed myriad  sophisticated pneumatic contraptions in the late nineteenth century to  precisely measure movement and make visible what is otherwise invisible,  including a machine that simulated a heart beat and a pulse-reading device that  was a precursor for medical imaging. The artist writes, &ldquo;What I like about  Marey's early medical apparatus is that while they reflect a naive faith in  mechanical models for biology they also embody the evolutionary design  necessary to get realistic results. &nbsp;They  were designed by experience just as we ourselves are.&rdquo;</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Born  in Baltimore, MD  Lubell is based in San Francisco,   CA. His interactive installations  have exhibited nationally and internationally, most recently at FACT, Liverpool  and V2 in Rotterdam.  Lubell has received numerous awards including and Award of Distinctio n from  Ars Electronica, an Adolph and Esther Gottlieb Foundation grant in 2009 and  Pollack Kranser Foundation Grants in 2002 and 1991.</font></p>
