        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
          San Jose Institute of Contemporary Art (ICA) announces the exclusive 
          California presentation of Manuel Neri's <i>The Figure in Relief</i>, 
          a comprehensive exhibition of painted sculptures, maquettes and works 
          on paper by this preeminent Bay Area-based sculptor. The show includes 
          work from the past 25 years that focuses on Neri's use of the fragmentary 
          and partial figure. The exhibition runs from November 8th through January 
          17th in the ICA's Main Gallery. <br>
          <br>
          For more than five decades, Neri has been exploring the human figure 
          in his art. He is known internationally for his life-size sculptures 
          in plaster, bronze, ceramic and marble as well as for his association 
          with the Bay Area figurative movement during the 1950s and 1960s. The 
          reliefs recall ancient Greek temple pediments and metopes as well as 
          Medieval altarpiece carvings and Renaissance relief sculpture. The carefully 
          curated exhibition showcases Neri's unique ability to depict the figural 
          form in various media.</font></p>
        <p align="left"> <font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The 
          ICA is truly honored to present this magnificent body of work by one 
          of today's most celebrated sculptors,&quot; says Cathy Kimball, ICA 
          Executive Director and Chief Curator. &quot;We encourage everyone to 
          visit the ICA to experience this stunning collection of figurative sculptures 
          and be inspired by the mastery of the medium achieved by this living 
          master.&quot; <br>
          <br>
          A 196-page monograph accompanies the exhibition and provides comprehensive 
          documentation of this unique series of sculptures. An opening reception 
          and catalogue signing by the artist will be held at the ICA on November 
          7th from 6pm to 8pm. On November 13th at 7pm the ICA's monthly art discussion 
          forum, <a href="file://///Server/my%20documents/ftp/public_html/talkingart08-09.htm">Talking 
          Art</a> will address Neri's 25-year teaching career at UC Davis and 
          the influence he's had on hundreds of artists. The session is entitled 
          <i>Figuratively Speaking: Tracing the Influence of a Teacher, a Program, 
          A Movement and a Place</i>, and the panel includes Bay Area artists 
          Robert Brady, Christopher Brown and Fred Snyder. <br>
          <br>
          Neri's work in plaster, ceramic, bronze and stone have merited him the 
          2006 Lifetime Achievement Award from the International Sculpture Center 
          in Hamilton, New Jersey. He will also be receiving the 2008 Bay Area 
          Treasure Award from the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art on November 
          12th. Manuel Neri was born in 1930 in the San Joaquin Valley to Mexican 
          immigrants and has lived in the Bay Area since 1950. Neri studied at 
          the California College of Arts &amp; Crafts and the California School 
          of Fine Arts (now the San Francisco Art Institute), where he also taught 
          from 1959 to 1965. He joined the faculty of the University of California, 
          Davis in 1965 and retired from teaching in 1990.<br>
