        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In celebration 
          of its new home, the San Jose Institute of Contemporary Art (ICA) is 
          proud to present <i>Home Sweet Home</i>, a group exhibition that opens 
          on June 8, 2007 in conjunction with the opening of the ICA's newly renovated 
          building at 560 South First Street. The inaugural exhibition will present 
          the work of 14 artists including Richard Barnes, Mark Bennett, Jim Campbell, 
          Jim Christensen, Stefan Kurten, Lewis deSoto, Doug Glovaski, Young Kim, 
          Cassandra C. Jones, Hung Liu, Oliver Michaels, Long Nguyen, Stephen 
          Sollins, and Catherine Wagner. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Opening 
          celebrations include a <b>public reception on Friday, June 8, 2007 from 
          7:00 - 9:00</b> pm and an <b>artists'</b> <b>panel discussion on Saturday, 
          June 9 at 11:00 am</b> (free for memebers, $5 for non-members), followed 
          by an <b>open house from 12:00 - 5:00 pm.</b> Printmaking demonstrations 
          and docent tours of the exhibiton are available throughout the day.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>From 
          Fact and Fantasy Artists Create Unique Images of Home</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The inaugural 
          exhibition, <i>Home Sweet Home</i>, examines the notion of home, not 
          merely as a physical structure, but as a place formed by memories and 
          a sense of belonging. From floor plans to coastlines to birds' nests 
          to wall paper, each of these artists shares his or her unique and distinctive 
          interpretation of &quot;home.&quot; </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Constructed 
          Memory</i> by new media artist Jim Campbell is a nostalgic memento of 
          his childhood home, which burnt to the ground soon after he left for 
          college. Lewis deSoto's series of prints, entitled <i>Memorium</i>, 
          represents houses in which the artist has lived. The floor plans are 
          created from memory and are based on perceptions and impressions from 
          experience. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Likewise, 
          Jim Christensen's autobiographical installation <i>ideal home (under 
          construction)</i> consists of three scale model versions of the first 
          homes that Christensen lived in as a child, stacked on top of one another. 
          Made of sugar pine and basswood and based on memory and photographs, 
          the houses are replicated in detail and shown in the early stages of 
          construction. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Relocating 
          from another country and moving from culture to culture transforms the 
          notion of home. Since her emigration from Korea to the US in 1974, Young 
          Kim has negotiated a balance between the notion of belonging to two 
          places. The geographical locations in <i>Untitled (Line)</i> are based 
          on real borders, whether they are coastlines or borders between countries. 
          However, Kim isolates these vast stretches of land, extracting them 
          from their actual geographic location, and thereby abstracting their 
          specificity. Hung Liu's self portrait, <i>Resident Alien</i>, is modeled 
          after her green card. Above her image, Liu inserts humor by using the 
          name &quot;Fortune Cookie,&quot; a sexual slang for Chinese women rather 
          than her own name. The painting shows the artist caught between the 
          two cultures that have shaped her life and speaks to her ambiguous sense 
          of home and identity as an immigrant in America. Long Nguyen's childhood 
          recollections of the Vietnam War are central to his work. He incorporates 
          landscape and the human form in fragmented and obscured shapes throughout 
          his paintings that refer to his homeland and his family's arduous journey 
          to the United States. Like Kim and Liu, Nguyen balances his sense of 
          home between two cultures and countries, both of which inform his identity.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Los Angeles-based 
          artist Mark Bennett has made art firmly rooted in the collective American 
          experience of television. His drawings and lithographs are &quot;blueprints&quot; 
          of famous television houses from such classic sitcoms as <i>The Andy 
          Griffith Show</i> and <i>I Love Lucy</i>. Several generations of Americans 
          spent many hours in these homes and the people that inhabited them subtly 
          informed our sense of home and family. Richard Barnes focuses on &quot;homes&quot; 
          in nature. His photographs of bird nests document the birds' incorporation 
          of human debris - string, newspaper, dental floss, hair, etc. - in the 
          construction of their homes. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In her 
          site-specific installation <i>Good Cheer</i>, Cassandra C. Jones digitally 
          manipulates internet images of cheerleaders to create colorful, kaleidoscopic 
          images that appear as intricate floral patterns. Upon closer scrutiny, 
          the images slowly dissolve into recognizable human forms. The interlocked, 
          splayed limbs, upraised legs and bare midriffs of the cheerleaders slowly 
          become visible. Jones reproduces these images on wallpaper, which she 
          hangs in a room reminiscent of a grandmother's dining room. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Cardinale 
          Project Room will feature a 14-minute video loop by Oliver Michaels 
          entitled <i>Train</i>, which offers an intimate and dislocating experience 
          of interior spaces. Michaels attaches his camera to a model train that 
          passes through a series of rooms that appear connected, but are actually 
          from multiple buildings. These disjunctive spaces become one vast fictional 
          set.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Other artists 
          in the show include Doug Glovaski, Stefan Kurten, Stephen Sollins, and 
          Catherine Wagner.</font></p>
