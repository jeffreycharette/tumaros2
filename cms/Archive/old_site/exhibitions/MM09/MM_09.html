      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The San Jose   Institute of Contemporary Art (ICA) presents it&rsquo;s Annual Monotype Marathon &ndash; a   print exhibition and fundraising auction that features the work of the best   printmakers in the Bay Area. The exhibition runs from July 1st to July 18th at   the ICA and culminates with a silent auction on the evening of July 18th. Event   sponsorships are on sale now at the ICA.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Monotype Marathon  begins with an intensive weekend of art-making by over <a href="file:///S|/ftp_Virigina/public_html/exhibitions/MM09/artistlist_updatedforsite_061709.pdf">seventy-five artists</a> in  printmaking studios throughout the Bay Area. These artists are invited by the ICA to produce a number  of prints during the weekend event being held on May 30th and 31st.  The  ICA selects the  best work produced by each artist to show in the exhibition and offers the work  for sale in the auction. Proceeds raised  from the event go toward the ICA&rsquo;s  exhibitions and educational programs. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">New to the event  this year is a show of prints from the ICA Print Center&rsquo;s Artists-in-Residence program. Work from these artists will be featured in  the exhibition and available for sale at the auction.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The ICA seeks support for the  Monotype Marathon from its members and from the community by selling event  sponsorships of $300 (<em>Sponsor</em> level)  and $600 (<em>Patron </em>level) that enable  artists to participate in the printmaking workshops. Each $300 <em>Sponsor </em>donation serves as the opening bid on any print in the auction, or can be  used toward the purchase of an ICA  Artist-in-Residence print. Each $600 <em>Patron</em> donation enables two artists to participate and allows the <em>Patron</em> to split the donation and bid on two prints at the auction,  or use it toward the purchase of an Artist-in-Residence print. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In addition,  members of the public are invited to learn about printmaking by creating their  own monotype at a Novice Printmaking Workshop being held on Saturday, July 11th  from 10am to 2pm at the ICA.  The workshop fee is $250 and includes all materials and lunch. Space is limited to eight participants. Call the ICA  at 408.283.8155 to register. </font></p>

      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The ICA Print Center is a fine art printmaking studio located at  the ICA. The full-service facility offers educational  programming, workshops, and production facilities to novice and experienced  artists. The studio is managed by an  on-site Master Printer and accommodates up to six artists.&nbsp; The 2009 workshop schedule is available  online at <a href="http://www.sjica.org">www.sjica.org</a>.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The ICA Artist-in-Residence  Program is an invitational program launched in November 2007. Each year four artists are invited by the ICA&rsquo;s curatorial staff to participate in two-week  residencies at the ICA   Print Center. Artists work with the ICA Master Printer to  create a suite of monotypes, an edition of etchings, an artist book, or another  print-based project of their choosing. A  complete list of participating artists is available on the ICA website. Prints from the editions can be purchased at  the ICA.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Monotype  Marathon 2009 is sponsored in part by Heritage Bank of Commerce. The ICA gratefully acknowledges additional support from the  David and Lucile Packard Foundation, and the Andy Warhol Foundation for Visual  Arts, Silicon Valley Community Foundation, Adobe Systems Incorporated, and  members of the ICA. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The  San Jose Institute of Contemporary Art (ICA) is  an energetic art space located in downtown San Jose dedicated to making contemporary art  accessible and exciting to audiences of all ages and backgrounds. Exhibitions are presented in three  galleries that display the most current, relevant and often challenging art  from the region, the nation and the world. The ICA is activated by opening receptions, South  First Friday gallery walks, after-dark programming in the front windows, panel  discussions, printmaking workshops, brown bag lunches and impromptu  conversations in the galleries. Admission is always free.</font></p>
