      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The San  Jose Institute of Contemporary Art (ICA)  presents <em>Manifold</em>, a solo exhibition by  postminimalist sculptor and installation artist Theodora Varnay Jones.&nbsp; <em>Manifold</em> will be on view from November 7, 2009 through February 20, 2010.&nbsp; The installation in the ICA&rsquo;s Focus Gallery provides visitors with a  unique opportunity to see the breadth, depth and evolution of Varnay Jones&rsquo;  work over the past fifteen years.&nbsp;&nbsp; Comprised  of two-and three-dimensional works including drawings, constructed works and  re-conceptualized ready-made pieces, the exhibition reflects the artist&rsquo;s  systematic exploration of repetition, form and material.&nbsp; &nbsp;A  public reception will be held on Friday, November 6th from 6pm to 8pm. <br />
        <br />
        By using opposing media such as paper and rocks,  fiberglass and beeswax, clay and gauze, Varnay Jones creates objects infused  with a palpable tension between the conflicting nature of the materials and the  equilibrium of their carefully balanced compositions.&nbsp;&nbsp; The resulting forms are open-ended and  ambiguous, while also evoking concepts related to invisibility, emptiness,  memory, perception, and time.&nbsp;&nbsp; The  artist&rsquo;s careful layering of translucent and transparent materials traps light  within her works, creating restlessness between what is revealed and what is concealed within  the multiple layers of each piece.&nbsp; The  objects often reveal subtle hints at their hand-made quality despite the  precision of their construction.<br />
          <br />
          &ldquo;Throughout our 29-year history, the ICA has maintained a  reputation for discovering new talent as well as providing meaningful exposure  for under-recognized mid-career artists,&rdquo; says ICA Executive Director, Cathy  Kimball.&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;During the past 30 years, Theodora has  created a diverse body of work that includes sculpture, drawings, prints,  assemblages and installations.&nbsp; &nbsp;<em>Manifold</em> presents an exciting and unique opportunity to see and experience how this  accomplished artist&rsquo;s work has evolved during the last decade,&quot; explains Kimball.<br />
          <br />
        A <em>Talking  Art</em> conversation with Varnay Jones will be held on Thursday, January 14,  2010 from 7pm to 9pm at the ICA.&nbsp; &nbsp;An  accomplished printmaker, &nbsp;Varnay Jones  has also been invited to participate in the ICA Print Center&rsquo;s 2010 <em>Artist in Residence </em>Program.<br />
      </font><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br />
        Hungarian-born Varnay Jones has lived in San Francisco for over  thirty-five years. &nbsp;&nbsp;She received her BFA  and MFA from the Academy of Fine Arts in Budapest.  &nbsp;&nbsp;Her works have been exhibited  extensively, nationally, and in Europe and Asia  and she has received numerous awards and grants.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Also opening on November 7th at the ICA, &nbsp;<em><a href="http://sjica.org/exhibitions/Afterlife/afterlife.html">Afterlife</a></em> &ndash; a group exhibition of works that explores new  meanings and new lives of discarded and re-used materials. &nbsp;&nbsp;The show will be on view in the &nbsp;ICA&rsquo;s Main Gallery and  Cardinale Project Room through January 23, 2010. &nbsp;Guest curated by Kathryn Funk, <em>Afterlife</em> includes  sculpture, video, and multi-media work from artists Claudia Borgna, Mark Fox-Morgan,  Elisabeth Higgins O&rsquo;Connor, Lisa Kokin, Charlotte Kruk, Robert Larson, Scott  Oliver, Beverly Rayner, and Ann Weber. &nbsp;A  public reception will be held on Friday, November 6, 2009 from 6pm to 8pm.</font></p>
