      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For the first time in its new building, the  San Jose Institute of Contemporary Art (ICA)  will fill its three galleries with the work of one artist. On January 31st, the  ICA will  present <strong><em>Lewis deSoto: BEFORE AFTER</em></strong>, the first comprehensive exhibition of  work by mid-career conceptual artist Lewis deSoto. The show runs through March 28th and includes  a selection of works on paper, photography, sculpture, sound pieces, and an  immersive, chocolate-scented&nbsp; installation  entitled <em>End of Desire</em>. An opening  reception with the artist will be held at the ICA on Friday, February 6th from 6pm to 8pm. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> <strong>ICA visitors who attend  the February 6th opening event will be treated to a special  one-night-only presentation of <em>Conquest</em>, the artist&rsquo;s counterfeit DeSoto  automobile, which will be parked outside the ICA.</strong> The custom-built car is based on a  1960&rsquo;s Chrysler platform and has been interpreted by deSoto with redesigned  instruments, wheel covers, roof design, monikers, upholstery, color schemes and  mechanical characteristics.&nbsp; DeSoto  created the project to trace the ironic threads of the name <em>DeSoto</em>: automobile, conquistador,  himself and his culture.&nbsp; </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Lewis deSoto has been  exploring personal narrative through his artwork for over 20 years using an  extraordinary&nbsp; range of media. &ldquo;The ICA is excited to shine a  light on the incredible depth and breadth of deSoto&rsquo;s work and pay tribute to  an artist at the top of his game,&rdquo; says Cathy Kimball, ICA Executive Director  and Chief Curator. &ldquo;Gallery visitors will be awestruck by the creative range of  the work and the unique immersive nature of the exhibition experience.&rdquo; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
           <br> 
          DeSoto&rsquo;s multimedia  installations combine sound, light, video, space, and sculpture elements and  are site-specific or oriented toward making a complete environment. His  conceptual artwork utilizes automobiles, inflatables, electronics, photography,  wood and metal construction. Two particularly intriguing works in the  exhibition include a sound piece and a large chocolate-scented installation.  The sound piece titled <em>Lament,</em> uses  the acoustics of the ICA&rsquo;s exit corridor to create an immersive sound-filled  environment created by the artist&rsquo;s collaboration with opera singer Erin Neff  singing excerpts from the Hermann Hesse poem &ldquo;(Klage) Lament.&rdquo; &nbsp;The large-scale <em>End of Desire</em> installation includes a long wooden pier surrounded  by cocoa bean shells spread out on the floor, creating an  organic landscape. Standing on the platform, enveloped by the potent smell of  chocolate, participants are left to ponder the nature of desire. This work follows  earlier projects that used fragrance to communicate the artist&rsquo;s narrative.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The  ICA&rsquo;s Focus  Gallery will include three sculptures that pay homage to deSoto&rsquo;s father as  well as a series of works on paper based on the 1920 novella by Herman Hesse  titled &ldquo;Klingsor&rsquo;s Last Summer.&rdquo; A series of photographs called <em>BASHO</em> (meaning &ldquo;place&rdquo; in Japanese)  represents deSoto&rsquo;s first one-person photography exhibition in 1978. And using  the paintings of Johannes Vermeer as inspiration for <em>The Restoration</em>, deSoto remodeled a garage to  resemble a Vermeer interior. In it, he placed figures in contemporary and 17th  century period garb surrounding a 1964 Pontiac Grand Prix to stage a scene that  floats between photographic, painterly and cinematic forms.<br>
        <br>
        DeSoto&rsquo;s  conceptually driven artwork brilliantly combines the past and present, and  posits about the future. Culling from a range of influences including  anthropology, sociology, history, religion, literature, music and personal  memory, he utilizes a variety of media to provide commentary on his personal  histories as they apply to contemporary culture.<br>
        <br>
        The ICA&rsquo;s <em>Talking Art</em> discussion forum on March 12  will feature the artist discussing the exhibition within the context of his  larger body of work. The session begins at 7pm and is open to the public.  Admission to <em>Talking Art</em> is free for ICA members and non-members  are charged a nominal entrance fee. <br>
        <br>
