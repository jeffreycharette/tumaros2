											<h1 class="header">The Capital Campaign</h1>
											<p>The excitement is mounting as the ICA is poised to take one of its most significant steps forward over its 26-year history. This pivotal turning point in the ICA&rsquo;s leadership position as the South Bay&rsquo;s most prominent presenter of contemporary art will occur in August 2006, when the ICA moves to its first-ever permanent home. Located at <a onclick="CSAction(new Array(/*CMP*/'C0E0FA890'));return CSClickReturn()" href="#" csclick="C0E0FA890">560 South First Street</a> in the center of downtown San Jose&rsquo;s burgeoning SoFA arts district, the <b>7,500 square foot</b> building will be completely renovated to accommodate the ICA&rsquo;s expanded exhibition programming and new educational initiatives.</p>
											<p>Setting the pace for the fast-track renovation and innovative expansion of programming, the ICA will program exhibitons through the end of the year in the first of three renovated gallery spaces planned for the new location:</p>
											<ul>
												<li type="disc"><a href="../exhibitions/current/gallery_main/NextNew.html">NextNew2006: Art and Technology</a> (Aug 8 - September 16)
												<li type="disc"><a href="../exhibitions/future/gallery_main/Fall_Auction_2006/auction2006.html">Fall Exhibition and Auction</a> (October 6 - October 28)
												<li type="disc">Darren Waterston immersive mural installation (November 17 - January 5)
											</ul>
											<p>The ICA will close on January 6, 2007, to complete the large-scale renovation project. Projected to open in June 2007, major improvements to the new ICA location include:</p>
											<ul>
												<li type="disc">A 40% increase in gallery space:1 large gallery, 2 small galleries, 1 project space.
												<li type="disc">The additional space allows for continuous exhibitions for the first time in the ICA&rsquo;s history.
												<li type="disc">Improved gallery infrastructure: precise climate control and controlled lighting.
											</ul>
											<p>Expanded educational programming, including a permanent printmaking workshop, an artist-in-residency program, printmaking classes, and a contemporary art library/resource center.</p>
											<p>Established in 1980, the San Jose Institute of Contemporary Art seeks to engage Bay Area audiences of all ages and backgrounds through compelling visual art exhibitions and educational programs. With a committed emphasis on the art of our time, the ICA exhibits young, emerging talent, as well as established artists, especially from the Bay Area. The Institute provides a forum for risk-taking and innovation, resulting in exhibitions that pose questions, challenge visitors to confront their own assumptions, and inspire them to look for new connections between themselves and the work before them.</p>
											<p>Since 1980, the San Jose Institute of Contemporary Art ( ICA) has served the South Bay region with innovative and thought-provoking exhibitions and educational programs centered on the art of our time. Our mission is to make contemporary art accessible and understandable to audiences of all ages and backgrounds and to introduce new ideas and perceptions of our contemporary culture.</p>
											<p>For the last 15 years, the ICA has operated in a 5,000 square-foot leased industrial facility with no amenities in the culturally rich SoFA district in downtown San Jose. In the early years, our one main gallery showcased six to seven exhibits annually.</p>
											<p>By 2005, we had added two smaller gallery spaces, the <a href="../underconstruction.html">Night Moves</a> program and <a href="../underconstruction.html">Talking Art</a>, doubling the number of exhibitions each year. The success of these programs has yielded amazing results. Our annual attendance has grown from 8,000 to 28,000 and our membership has tripled. For the first time in our history, we had to turn people away at our <a href="../underconstruction.html">2005 Fall Auction</a>.</p>
											<p>The limitations of the physical space coupled with skyrocketing rents led the Board of Directors to conclude that the best scenario for the ICA was to own and occupy a larger, more flexible facility that both supports our current programs and gives us room to grow appropriately. Committed to staying in the SoFA arts and entertainment district in downtown San Jose, when the opportunity came to purchase the building at 560 South First Street, we leapt.</p>
											<p>With the impetus of a $750,000 gift from a generous ICA patron and a $500,000 grant from the City of San Jose Redevelopment Agency, the Board of Directors raised an additional $500,000 internally and on April 28, 2006 the ICA became the owner of 560 S. First, thus ensuring our institutional stability well into the future.</p>
